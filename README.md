**Tools Used:**
Excel: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation


**Industry Context:**


In the manufacturing and logistics industry, shipment performance, payment tracking, and content-wise revenue generation are critical metrics. This dashboard helps the company monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) to optimize shipment operations, streamline payments, and identify high-performing content categories.


**Project Objective:**


To build an Excel-based dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of shipment performance, financial health, and content-wise charges, enabling the company to make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and profitability.


**About the Data:**


    Shipment Data: Includes delivery status (Delivered, Not Delivered), shipment domain (Domestic, International), customer details, and shipment weights.
    Financial Data: Includes payment status (Paid, Not Paid), payment mode (Card Payment, COD), and associated amounts.
    Content Data: Lists shipment content categories and their respective charges.
    Timeframe: Data spans from 2011 to 2019 with yearly filters for dynamic analysis.


**Data Preprocessing:**


    Handling Missing and Inconsistent Data:
        Cleaned null values in weight and charge columns to ensure accurate calculations.
        Standardized payment mode names for consistency (e.g., "Card Payment" and "COD").


    Data Aggregation and Sorting:
        Aggregated data by shipment domain, delivery status, and payment modes to calculate total charges, average shipment weights, and unpaid amounts.
        Grouped content categories to calculate total charges for each type.


    Column Creation:
        Created derived metrics such as total customers, average shipment weight, and domain-wise percentages.


    Visualization Preparation:
        Organized data for easy visualization using pivot tables and charts, ensuring dynamic updates with slicers and filters.


**Actionable Insights:**


    Domestic Delivery Challenges:
        Domestic shipments have higher non-delivery rates, indicating potential logistics inefficiencies or customer issues.


    Revenue Balance Between Domains:
        Domestic shipments contribute slightly more (54%) to total charges than international ones (46%), showing nearly balanced performance.


    Customer Payment Trends:      
  COD (Cash on Delivery) is the most preferred payment method but has significant unpaid amounts, impacting cash flow.




    High-Performing Categories:
        Industrial Equipment generates the highest revenue, followed by Automotive and Arts & Crafts.


    Shipment Weight Impact:
        Not Delivered shipments have significantly higher weights and charges, especially in the domestic domain, suggesting potential cost savings by addressing delivery challenges.


**Key Results:**


    Visualized domain-wise and status-wise shipment performance using pie charts and bar charts.
    Highlighted payment mode trends and unpaid amounts to prioritize collections.
    Identified top content categories for targeted business strategies.
    Enabled interactive exploration using slicers for shipment domain, payment status, and customer type.


**Business Impact:**


    Improved Logistics Efficiency: Addressing high non-delivery rates in domestic shipments can reduce costs and improve delivery times.
    Optimized Revenue Collection: Targeted efforts on COD collections can significantly improve cash flow and financial health.
    Strategic Focus on Top Categories: Investing in high-performing categories like Industrial Equipment and Automotive can maximize revenue growth.
    Balanced Operations: Insights from domestic and international contributions support a balanced approach to resource allocation.
